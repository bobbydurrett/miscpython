# miscpython

These are Python modules that I wrote. I have tried to make them general purpose. I'm thinking that as I study algorithms and data structures or other things like that I might build modules that I could use. 

Of course in many cases there are better modules out there but it is nice to have these that I have written.

## EDX Classes

The first two are from two edX classes that I took:

* `binarysearch.py` - Looks up a key in a sorted list using [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)

* `bisection.py` - Searches a range of values for one that causes a function to produce a certain result. Uses [bisection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)
               
## Utility functions:

* `runutils.py` - A simple function that I might use to run scripts or programs

* `uploadfile.py` - Script to upload a file to Sharepoint on Office 365. Also checks in file.

* `remotescript.py` - Runs a list of Unix or Linux shell script commands on a remote server.

* `dbversion.py` - Returns the version of an Oracle database

* `tnsnamesparser.py` - Pulls information from a tnsnames.ora file

* `dbspace.py` - Returns the size of an Oracle database and the number of non-system objects

* `backupremote.py` - Copy all the files in a directory tree down from a remote Linux server to a local Windows machine using sftp

* `elapsedtoseconds.py` - Convert sqlplus elapsed time to seconds
